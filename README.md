# Aviation Productivity Theme

[![Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/ts-ignore.aviation-productivity-theme.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ts-ignore.aviation-productivity-theme)

Dark cockpit focus, light radar sidebars.  
Inspired by avionics and human-machine interface (HMI) design in aviation systems.

Ideal for developers who want high signal-to-noise UI and attention guidance like in real cockpits.

## Design Notes

This theme applies ergonomic color hierarchy principles from aircraft HMI:

- **Muted low-priority visuals for whitespace, indentation, and comments**  
- **Precision readability for critical text elements like parameters and return types**
